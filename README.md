Hello people,
I thought it would be nice to have a discussion platform for the numerical modelling course.
So I tried to make such a Github thing, let's see if it works...
I did not find all people in our course, so if you know the user names of the missing people, invite them (or, if this doesn't work, let me know their names, then I can invite them, I hope...).
:)
